Welcome to the Fashion Outfit Generator web app! This project was developed as a submission for the Flipkart GRID 5.0 competition. The app utilizes advanced technologies to recommend the perfect fashion outfit based on user preferences, purchase history, and current trends.

## Features

- **Smart Recommendations:** Our app leverages OpenAI's API to perform prompt engineering and generate tailored outfit recommendations.
- **Data Scraping:** We utilize the Cheerio library in NodeJS to scrape relevant fashion data from the Flipkart website.
- **Web Server:** The app is powered by the Express library, creating a robust web server to handle user interactions.
- **Customization:** Users can not only generate outfits but also fine-tune them by providing specific prompts.
- **History Management:** Keep track of your outfit history and revisit your favorite styles.
